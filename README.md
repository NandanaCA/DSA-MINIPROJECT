# DSA-MINIPROJECT
There are four test files for checking different scenarios.

test1.txt is used to test out dijksta, bellman-ford and floyd-warshall algorithms.
To execute this, type test1.txt.

test2.txt is used to test out bfs algorithm.
To execute this, type test2.txt.

test3.txt is used to display the runtime of algorithms for weighted graphs.
To execute this, type test3.txt.

test4.txt is used to display the runtime of algorithms for unweighted graphs.
To execute this, type test4.txt.

Thank you.
