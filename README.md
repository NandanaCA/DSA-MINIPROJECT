# DSA-MINIPROJECT
There are four test files for checking different scenarios.

test1.txt is used to test out dijksta, bellman-ford and floyd-warshall algorithms.
To execute this, make sure line no 306 is uncommented and lines 307-309 are commented.

test2.txt is used to test out bfs algorithm.
To execute this make sure line no 307 is uncommented and line 306,308,309 are commented.

test3.txt is used to display the runtime of algorithms for weighted graphs.
To execute this make sure line no 308 is uncommented and line 306,307,309 are commented.

test4.txt is used to display the runtime of algorithms for unweighted graphs.
To execute this make sure line no 309 is uncommented and line 306,307,308 are commented.

Thank you.
